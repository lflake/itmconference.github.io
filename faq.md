## Answers to frequently asked questions

 - **Who usually attends this conference?**  
 
You can find links to information about [past conferences on our website]({{ site.baseurl}}#section-previous). Many conference attendees work with public agencies (Federal, State + Local), academia (students, researchers, + professors), or private firms focusing on transportation data and travel modeling & forecasting (consulting + software vendors). The conference is open to everyone interested in or with something to contribute to the field of transportation data, modeling, forecasting, and other related topics.
	
 - **What makes for a good content proposal and/or abstract?**  
 
A good content proposal has an objective that is of clear use to the field, can be understood beyond a limited audience, limits the use of unnecessary buzz words, and provides a complete but concise synopsis of what is going to be presented.  Don't mistake the brevity of the maximum submission length for shallowness. Rather, use it as an opportunity to develop your "elevator pitch" for what you want to offer.  Clear communication and well-written English is key.
	
 - **The conference is focused on “innovation” -- can we still submit content about work that’s tried & true in practice?**  
 
To the extent that something tried and true can address the questions and issues brought forward in the {{ site.baseurl }}/call-for-content }}, yes.  For topics that are more focused on planning applications, there is a separate conference specifically about that: the [TRB Planning Applications Conference](http://trbappcon.org), which will be held next in the Twin Cities, MN in Spring/Summer 2021.
	
 - **What level of experience or expertise should conference presenters have?**  
  
We’re looking to hear from anyone with something to contribute, whether you’ve been in your field for one year or thirty.  If you feel like you want some extra help with composing your submission, or require assistance in preparing for your presentation, we are [happy to help](mailto://elizabeth@urbanlabs.io). 
	
 - **If I want to propose something like a data competition or a tutorial, how much do I need to have prepared for the initial conference submission?**  
 
You need to have a clear and obviously useful objective as well as demonstrate the pathway and means to pull it off. For example, don't propose a data competition that would require proprietary data that you yourself, the conference organizers, or a co-author cannot provide access to.  However, you certainly don't have to have it **all** figured out at this stage.  Specifically, if you know that you will need help with a certain aspect (i.e. somebody to give an overview about how to use python package XX to implement YY), just call that out in your submission and we can help you out. 
	
- **What criteria is used to select speakers and presenters at the conference?**  
 
Content that relates to the focus areas in the Call for Content will be given priority. At this initial stage, we will assess content proposals based on responsiveness as well as the  *"what makes a good content proposal..."* answer above. Based on the content type, we will request a subsequent, secondary submission which will be used to make the final selection for conference contributors.  The secondary submission could be a moderate-length technical paper for new innovations, a syllabus for a tutorial, lecture notes for a lecture, etc.

- **Why is this process so early compared to previous years?  Why a two-stage submission?**

The conference organizers got feedback that the program for previous Innovations in Travel Modeling Conferences was put together later than desired in order for many people to make appropriate travel requests. Additionally, we did not want to conflict with TRB Annual Meeting paper-writing and reviewing season (July - Sept 15th). Finally, since we were changing up the conference format, we wanted as much time as possible to understand how the program might work.  In order to meet the schedule, not conflict with existing conference workload demands, but also not demand too much detail about something so far off, we decided to ask for preliminary submissions that would help us shape our conference now...and put off the detailed work load for the fall. This also makes sure that people do not spend too much time on submissions that are unlikely to make the final program.
